Sir, I had completed all my tasks in June itself, but I didn't get any message from my captain for certificates, so I reached out to them after a week the tell me to give my tasks via Github,Earlier I had completed my task by posting my code in the comments and then taking screenshots of my code as well as output. Now they are telling me to send my task via GitHub, Nobody informed earlier when I started working on my task, but now they are, after all my hard work, SO I am sending you the screenshots of both my codes and the output of it. Kindly review it.
